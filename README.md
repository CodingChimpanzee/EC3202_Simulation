# EC3202_Simulation

main.m -> Produces output of fourier transform/inverse fourier transform/correlation

Temporal_consistency.m -> Produces output of correlation using Temporal consistency

You only need to run these files to get results.
Also, if you want to get an activation map, please access to Correlation.m file and activate imagesc(value) in below and deactivate imshow() fuction.

I know that phase correlation is not a good way to do this simulation. However, our class was encouraged to use it to see that this correlation method "can" work. Thus I didn't used cross correlation method in here.
